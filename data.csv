"Reliable Spec Information","I normally don't do reviews but, if you're like me you also scoured the internet and found nothing on this laptop based on the model number provide or the pictures. There's conflicting information from the representative and the photos/specs provided so this is the specs as it sits in my hands. Specs: All plastic shell IdeaPad 3 14ADA05 81W0003QUS Ryzen 5 3500u 3 USB-A ports, 1 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0, there is no USB-C on this device. Do not use the answer from the representative as correct on this one. I even asked a more clarifying question and was told there is a USB-C, but you cannot charge over it. The screen is a 1920x1080 TN panel, no touch screen 256GB NVME drive - no spinning HDD, so disregard the section that says 7200rpm on the description page 8gb of DDR4 ram at 2400mhz 3 cell battery - seems okay power saving options gives it roughly 8hrs depending on what you're doing and your tolerable screen brightness (but your mileage may vary) There is no back lit keyboard. The keys feel textured and not smooth like some other laptops which, personally I prefer it. Review: This appears to be Lenovo's answer to the mid-grade $400-$600 laptop shortage. If I had to guess it seems like this is in the chaise of the S145 with a 3500u APU. Compared to my wife's Lenovo IdeaPad FLEX-14API with the same processor, ram, and SSD - performance wise it matches, but that's not the end of it. Her computer has what feels to be an all metal design, the ability to flip into a tablet, backlit keyboard, touchscreen, and a much better IPS display (still 1920x1080) with better viewing angles. We purchased this for her last July, 2019 and the difference of final price was ~$75 higher. At the time of writing this the same laptop goes for $750 on Amazon for the ""New"" model and $699 for a used model. Conclusion: If you need a sub $500 laptop right now, this is a solid purchase as long as you know what you're getting. If on the other hand you have the luxury of waiting a few months I would wait. If the prices/stock stabilize you can get much more bang for your buck for nearly the same amount of money. More laptops with the Ryzen 5 4500u is going to be coming out over the summer with 20% more power and it's suppose to come in at a similar price point. Even if they come at a higher price point it will drive the price of the 3500u down.

"Can't Beat The Price For This Performance!","The Lenovo Ideapad 3 14 laptop is a very solid laptop and a must-buy for just $450. To start off with the pros, This laptop is very light, portable, fast, and powerful. I'm a college student going into I.T. and I edit videos a lot. The RAM, GPU, and CPU can easily handle that type of workload for 1080p video. The Ryzen 5 3500U with Radeon Vega 8 Graphics is more than capable of handling light gaming, 1080p editing, Unity/Unreal/Blender rendering, and absolutely blazes through everyday tasks. The keyboard has a phenomenal feel to it. While it's definitely no Thinkpad keyboard, it feels much better than most laptop keyboards out there. The membranes give a nice, tactile, solid feel to each large key, providing a comfortable, solid, satisfying typing experience. The 256GB NVMe SSD gives the laptop a very snappy speed, with a near-instant boot time. While the storage capacity is definitely not vast, it makes up for it in speed. The Ideapad 3 also includes 2 USB 3.0 ports, so an external SSD/HDD is definitely a viable option if you want more storage on the laptop. (it's what I did.) The 1080p display is crisp, sharp , and beautiful (if you spend some time color adjusting the screen in the Radeon settings.) It's definitely more than viable for watching movies, streaming TV shows, or editing videos in 1080p. Now for the cons, The Ideapad 3's battery is definitely not a poor one, but it's far from great. On max performance mode, I rarely get more than 2 hours of battery life out of this computer on full brightness. However, running this on the ""better battery"" mode barely sacrifices any performance for me, and I've been able to get a significant 4-6 hours of battery life when running that mode. The trackpad is a very smooth experience, yet moving your finger around on it produces a weird knocking sound occasionally, but I've found this to quiet down as the laptop is used more often. Minor gripe. I know a lot of people have complained about the screen on this computer, but honestly, it's far from a bad display. Sure, it only goes up to 220 nits (from my testing) so it can't realistically be used outside on a sunny day, but for indoor use, even in a bright room, the display is easy to look at and is bright enough to be very clear. Now, keep in mind, the screen comes with all the downfalls of a TN panel, with viewing angles being rather lackluster, but while looking straight at the computer, there's few displays you can get that beats this one for a sub $500 laptop paired with this powerful hardware. In conclusion, If you're looking for a good laptop for under $500 that doesn't look or feel cheap despite the (very solid in my opinion) plastic construction, this Lenovo is an absolute no-brainer. The Ryzen 5 and Vega 8 provides performance akin to laptops over double this one's price. If portability, power, and convenience are what you're keeping an eye out for, I can easily highly recommend this computer.

"","I wanted  a light 14 inch laptop for school work(mostly for pdf reading, zoom, excel, running regressions on R etc.). If you're looking at his model then you are likely looking at something in the budget of 600-900 CAD, from what I have seen the price fluctuates from mid 800s to the low 600. For around 650 your getting a great deal. The only issue is that the screen is a bit dark but its not really an issue if your on 90% brightness. Battery seems to last around 7 hours with consistent use. Its made of plastic but it has a brushed metallic feel that feels premium. The keyboard is a Lenovo keyboard that is super conformable to use. The AMD APU is pretty good its equivalent to an intel i7 (mobile cpu) from around 4 years ago. For what you're paying for the Screen and camera quality is what you pay for. There is a hard drive slot if you choose to expand your storage. I highly suggest upgrading the ram from 8GB to 12GB by replacing the 4gb stick. By default you only have around 3GB of free Ram to use which could be an issue depending on your work load. I spoke with Crucial representative asking for which ram module would be Ideal for the this model and he recommended the Crucial 8GB Memory model: CT8G4SFS824A (shop around amazon and Newegg you can save a couple of dollars) Read more","06 Oct 2020","","","Yes","Paperclip","","","https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Processor-Graphics-81W0003QUS/dp/B0862269YP/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3P5DT0FR00JCA&dchild=1&keywords=lenovo+laptop&qid=1605451558&sprefix=lenovo%2Caps%2C383&sr=8-2

"Don't buy - really slow!!!","Wanted a Windows 10 laptop (not a Chromebook) for our child to use.  It's a simple machine right out of the box which is what we expected.  Has a nice ""metal"" finish, and the keyboard is solid.  The problem is that it struggles to perform any basic task with a slow AMD processor and only 4GB of RAM.  Loading a web page is painfully slow.  Pay a little more and get an Intel processor.  To put it simply, our Windows 7 Dell that is 9 years old is faster than this machine!!! Pros: - looks good; nice ""metal"" finish - like the keyboard layout - Windows 10: some people complain about 10s.  You can find instructions online on how to easily convert from 10s to standard - fast startup: you will need to let it update/restart a few times Cons: - incredibly slow: can't emphasize enough how slowly basic web pages load, let alone video, or heaven forbid simple games for kids - no USB C port - charger feels really cheap; wouldn't doubt if you need to replace it within a year. Knockoff design of an Apple charger but the plug into the laptop is flimsy, and the prongs that go into the wall don't fold inward.

"DON’T BUY IT","I wanted a laptop just for working. Use Microsoft Word and YouTube videos, that’s all. And it doesn’t even work for that. IT IS SUPER SLOW!!!!! It’s crazy how slow this is. You can’t do a thing in it. Also it only comes with 56.9 GB, THAT’S NOTHING. It’ll be full in a week. And even worse, windows occupies 34.1 of those 56.9 GB, it’s so bad. The camera is also bad. Really bad. It’s like those cameras from 2010’s phones and I’m not exaggerating. The ONLY thing I like is the design because it looks elegant and doesn’t weight much, perfect to take it to your work. But, man. It’s so slow for working. Also it gets very hot just for using it for a moment while opening google (which takes minutes to open). I’m really disappointed. I waited 2 weeks for nothing. This is my first big disappointment. I saw all the other comments on how slow this is, but I thought people were just using it for games and I knew it wasn’t a laptop for gaming. Don’t buy this. It’s just a disappointment. I think I can replace the memory card for a bigger one and I’ll do the same with the memory RAM. That’s probably it. But it’s going to cost more money. EDIT. Hi, it’s me again almost two months later. I’m updating My opinion because I said I was going to replace the memory card and RAM. But you can’t even do that with this laptop. Every hardware of this laptop comes united, so you can’t change one thing of it. Do you want proves? You can’t find any hardware of this laptop anywhere on internet, and that’s because you can’t replace a thing of it. What did I do? I sold it for a very cheaper price, thus making me lose money. Anyways, don’t buy it. This laptop doesn’t work nor NOTHING. Too slow for working even on Microsoft Word, memory card is too small, it gets hot using it for 10 minutes. Don’t worth it.

"Not what I hoped","I have to remember that you get what you pay for. Out of the box, this laptop booted up in ""Windows S Mode,"" which I had never heard of before -- it stops you from installing any programs other than from the Windows App Store, using any web browser except Microsoft Edge, and using any search engine other than Bing.  45 minutes later, we had figured out how to permanently stop that. After that... it's just a really slow laptop. We had purchased it for our elementary school student to do remote learning.  It ... barely gets by. Worst is trying to do the video calling in Google Classroom, where it takes 2 minutes to prepare, and then frequently just quits.  At this point, we loan our child a ""real"" laptop from an adult, then use the Lenovo for the less-processor/memory intensive educational software. Finally, we tried to set up Minecraft, which ran at about 4 fps.  Many Google searches later, we found enough ways to turn every single game option down until the game will stagger along. So ... I can't really blame this laptop; it's super cheap. But compared to any other laptop I've ever owned, this one is surprisingly terrible.

"Sleek, light, quick - so far, so good!","I bought my Lenovo Yoga C740 at BestBuy (the exact same color and specs that Amazon sells here and the exact same price) and have been using it for about two weeks. I will start with a possible warning, which may or may not turn out to be an issue - the laptop might be dropping randomly wifi connections. Mine did it a few times. Reconnecting is easy but no other laptop or any other smart device at home does it, so it might be a specific issue related to this laptop line. The Lenovo Yoga 730 and C940 lines appear to be having similar wifi issues and there are threads on the Lenovo forums about this problem, offering a number of possible solutions. Otherwise, the machine is very competent - light (about 3 lbs., 1.4 kg.), thin, comfortable, quick. Typing is easy, and the keys are very comfortable, the backlit keyboard has two settings, and the fingerprint sensor is accurate and fast. The battery is outstanding. It seems to last about 8-9 hours on full brightness and probably 14-15 hours on half (I read online reviews where it indeed lasted for 15 hours). The processor is good, although there are better 10th generation Intel i5 models out there, but the laptop is comfortably quick. The screen is bright, the colors are accurate and feel slightly warm. The webcam is fine (720p HD) and has a privacy shutter (a nice decision - it is built-in and requires you to slide it with your nails or with something very thin - the tiny sliding panel is located right above the webcam). The audio is quite loud, coming from a pair of Dolby Atmos speakers. The fan is quiet. It's a 2-in-1 type (Lenovo calls, in fact, a 4-in-1 ), and tablet mode also works well. The ports of the C740 are a bit unusual. It has two USB-C ports and one USB-A 3.1 port. You can charge it in any of the two USB-C ports (the charging adapter has a USB-C jack). It lacks an HDMI port. I bought a small hub from Amazon (QGeeM USB C Hub) that works well with it and has an HDMI port plus some more USB-A ports. I can also confirm that the laptop works well with a Wacom Bamboo Ink pen. It also works with a Lenovo Active Pen 1 or 2 (according to Lenovo). I only tested it with the Bamboo Ink stylus and have had no issues. One final word of caution: beware McAfee LiveSafe that might come pre-installed (the BestBuy model did). Years ago, I used to test AV software as a hobby. McAfee was always a pain to remove and would brick machines worse than other AV programs. This has not really changed over the years. On the day I bought this laptop, I almost returned it back to BestBuy, because after setting Windows 10 for the first time, McAfee got stuck with a bad update and I had to reset Windows because it became unresponsive and would load but then freeze. It was quite a fight to get it to start the resetting process because it would begin to do so and freeze again. After Windows was reset and McAfee removed, there have been no issues. To sum up, it's a nice, pretty stylish laptop. I would think that it is a bit overpriced (cheaper laptops from HP and Dell come with stronger Intel 10th generation i5 processors), but if you pair it against a MacBook (and it looks as nice or even nicer than a MacBook) - then the price would seems good.

"Great for Back To School during online only classes","I have always been a Lenovo fan but my wife on the other had has always had Dell. I hoped to convert her with this Laptop and she loves it. First of all the build quality is amazing since it has an all aluminum body which feels very premium. The screen is awesome at 1080p but do recommend getting a screen protector if you will be using touch since it is glossy and will get finger prints. The one I used was ""Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector Designed for Asus Chromebook Flip C434TA"" on amazon which fit it perfectly after reading about someone doing the same. The speakers on this laptop are amazing with Dolby Audio I was amazed at what I was actually hearing! Keyboard is nice and comfortable to type on with feedback just so satisficing. Pairing with Lenovo Active Pen 2 which I bought from amazon really adds value to this laptop when writing notes.

"My favorite laptop ever!","I work from home and have a heavier Lenovo Thinkpad from work. This one is a lot more portable - around the house and when traveling. It's very responsive and quick. I use a blue marble ""skin"" on it to protect it from scratches. I am a 66 yr old educator who creates online graduate courses for a college in Chicago. I work remotely from Florida and have no problem doing my work on this Yoga. In fact, I've hardly used my work laptop since getting this one 2 mos ago. Favorite features: thin profile, screen brightness, backlit keyboard, and finger recognition for login (which works amazingly well). I've never regretted getting this laptop and highly recommend it.

"Best Laptop for College Students!!","Looking for a laptop for myself, a freshmen in college, I was so scared that I would purchase the wrong laptop. I looked and compared things for weeks on end. This was the best laptop that I could have ever bought for myself. It runs great, I find no problems in it being slow. The Touch screen works great. I love that I can fold it in have and use it as a tablet if I want. Sometimes when I'm laying in bed to watch a movie I can flip the screen backwards to stand it up. The sound is also amazing on this thing! I am able to have a lot of tabs open at once for school and I have had absolutely no troubles with anything so far. The camera quality is also fantastic for those of you stuck in zoom classes. The battery also last me through at least one, if not two full days of usage. It's really nice that the charger for the computer is a US-C cable, it works perfectly with my pixel phone! If i ever need to charge anything I just switch back and forth between my computer and my phone. Although quick thing, if there are any gamers stumbling on this computer. Although, it is a very amazing computer but I seriously doubt you can run anything heavy duty on here such as a Call of Duty game, CSGO, or anything that needs a lot of ram. If you love playing minecraft though, I was able to run that very easily without no problem. Overall it is a great computer, if anything ever happens to this one I will for sure buy from this company again. Also extra brownie points for this company because it came in A WEEK EARLIER THAN IT WAS SUPPOSED TOO!! I was shocked to find it in the mail. Any college student looking for a nice computer for school, don't worry no more because this is your best option!

"Not a good value. The listing has misinformation. See below for a review of the laptop.","The first thing I want to say is this laptop is not a good value; the asking price is too high for what the product has to offer. This doesn't mean it's a bad laptop, rather, for the money, there are better options out there. The listing also has misinformation in it, notably it mentions an ""HD touch screen"" but this laptop does not have a touch screen. It also says it comes with Windows 10 Home, which is technically true, but it comes with S mode enabled. S mode does offer a value if this is going to be handed to a child who could be prone to getting viruses because this mode restricts executables (Apps) from running other than the Windows store. The good news is you can disable this, but it requires logging in with a microsoft account to do so. You also cannot revert back to S mode. To make this change, open Settings and go to Activation, then click the Go to the store option. Given that this laptop is a budget laptop, and is probably aimed at non-tech savvy users who just want a machine to do work or school on (with optional light gaming), the review won't be too technical and I'll try to explain things in a manner that anyone can understand without spitting out a bunch of numbers or tech terms. DISPLAY: Starting with the display itself, it's not very good. The viewing angles are bad, meaning when you look at it off angle as opposed to directly on, the picture starts to wash out and becomes more difficult to see. The resolution of the display is also only a baffling 1366x768, which falls short of the 1080p standard most displays are designed around. This means some websites will not scale properly on the display, as well as the picture not being as crisp as as 1080p screen would offer. The good news is the bezels, or the edging around the screen itself, is thin which looks nice and shows more of the screen. KEYBOARD: The keyboard is just okay to type on. You shouldn't have any problems writing school essays or work reports on this: the key travel (the distance the keys push down before they register the input--which helps people who type ""feel"" when the input is activated to facilitate typing) is fair but if you want to write a novel I suggest another laptop with a more mechanical feel. Also, notably, there is no backlight (when the keys light up so you can see the keyboard in the dark) which is a big disappointment. PORTS: The available ports are: (Right side = SD storage, aux port for wired headphones) // (Left side = HDMI out (so you can connect the laptop to another monitor or TV that has HDMI in which will then display your laptop screen on that monitor or TV), one USB 3.0 , and two USB 2.0. The difference between 3.0 and 2.0 is the transfer speeds. If you stick in a flash drive, make sure you use the 3.0 slot. You can tell which one is 3.0 by looking at the image I put in this review. CPU: The processor included in this laptop is a bit worse than the latest comparable Intel option, the i3 10th gen mobile, but it's also less expensive. This again goes into why I think this laptop doesn't have a great value, because to me it's worth $300 at most, but they're asking for over $400 for it. When you look at laptops in the $380 range, you're getting an intel i3 10th gen with a 1080p screen, and in some cases, more RAM and memory. However, that doesn't mean it's a bad processor. It's quite good for what it is, actually. If the most you want to get out of this is to watch 1080p videos (even though the resolution of this laptop doesn't go up to 1080p), the processor is more than capable of handling that. MEMORY: There is 4GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard, which is really the bare minimum a windows 10 laptop should have. Given that it's soldered, you aren't able to swap it out with something else, but the good news is there is an open slot on the motherboard to add your own RAM. If you want to go this route, which I suggest you do, here's what you want to buy:  you can go up to 8GB (for a total of 12--though I recommend just an additional 4GB stick for normal usage) of DDR4-2400Mhz 1.2v. If you're looking at a listing of ""laptop RAM"" make sure it falls within those specifications. Getting to the memory banks is easy, even if you aren't tech savvy I'll easily explain how to do it safely: 1) turn the laptop completely off. 2) use a small screwdriver to remove all the screw underneath the laptop (be sure not to lose them). 3) near the hinges, lift your fingers up and slowly and carefully pry the back of the case off. I was very careful and still broke some tabs because it's very cheaply made, but don't worry if you do--the tabs don't do a whole lot anyway. 4) once the back is off, add the RAM into the slot, and put the case back on and put the screws back in. Lastly, just make sure the case is sealed all around the edges by pinching them until it clicks back into place. STORAGE: The 128GB SSD included is in NVME form, which just means if you want to replace the storage (can't add onto it since there's only one slot for stoage), you can do so with a bigger NVME drive. To replace this, look at the above steps for replacing the RAM and also follow the software transfer guide incluided in the NVME package for moving the operating system and your files over to the new drive. TOUCHPAD: The touchpad is pretty good. It's fairly responsive and responds well to multi gesture touches, such as using two fingers to scroll up and down on webpages. WEBCAM: The webcam is horrendous. It will suffice at the bare minimum but the resolution is 480p at 30fps. If you don't know what that means, just understand it's well below average. Thankfully, there's a privacy shutter which blocks the webcam so certain malicious ads and attackers can't open your camera to see you while you are using the laptop. WEIGHT: The laptop itself is also too heavy for what it is. It's almost 5lbs. Other companies are able to shave almost a pound off of a similarly-sized laptop. CHASIS: The chasis of the laptop is made out of plastic through-and-through. It flexes incredibly easy, meaning if you press down on it with a bit of force, the plastic will bend. The panel is also easy to flex, but this is to be expected on a laptop in this price point. GAMING: This laptop is capable of doing light gaming. I didn't go too in depth with testing, but I did install minecraft and low visual settings, the game was running at a consistent 55fps for the most part, the lowest being a short dip of 18fps when it was loading a lot of things at once. There's only one heat pipe on the motherboard, so it's not really designed around cooling. The laptop will get pretty warm if you start to use it for heavy tasks, such as light gaming. BATTERY LIFE: The battery is decent. It could have been bigger, especially since there's plenty of real estate in the laptop to allow it, but it was is a cost-cutting decision. However, during my testing, when I ran this laptop at 80% brightness and using ""Better performance"" in Windows 10 for the power output, I was able to get around 6 hours of YouTube watching from 100% until it forced itself in sleep mode to prevent it from shutting down completely. SPEAKERS: The speakers are surprisingly decent. You won't be forced to use headphones with this. Other laptops that I've reviewed that are more expensive than this one had worse speakers, so this is a plus. If you do decide to get this laptop, here are some things you should know: +Setup is easy out of the box, but don't connect it to the internet until you get to the desktop otherwise it will force you to create a microsoft account. If you want to do that, go for it, but I'd avoid it. However, if you want to disable S mode, you'll need one anyway so weigh your options here. +It doesn't have bloatware at all, meaning you don't need to comb through the laptop to remove a bunch of unnecessary crap. In fact, the installed applications were one drive, some lenovo app, and office 365. I uninstalled 365 because I don't need it, but keep it if you do, I think they give you a free trial. +When you get to the desktop, click the start menu and type Update, click ""Check for updates"". Click ""Advanced Options"" and enable the first option which says to Receive updates for other MS products when you update windows"". Click the back arrow then click Check for updates and keep installing updates until there aren't any left to install. In conclusion, the asking price of this laptop is too high for what you're getting in return. There are other options that are cheaper or comparable that will get you more memory, a better CPU, and a better screen, but looking at this laptop in a vacuum, it's not bad for what it is.

"A Great Back-to-School Laptop for e-Learners","We purchased this laptop to replace a smaller Chromebook.  Now that kids are 'e-Learning', it is important to have a little horsepower and a larger screen.  This 15"" laptop fit the bill with 4GB of RAM and an SSD.  The AMD processor and integrated graphics work well and will play 'Fall Guys' and 'Roblox' just fine.  Don't expect any real gaming performance, but it is a great value overall. The only negative is the webcam.  Underwhelming resolution and frame-rate.  Charge a couple of more bucks, and throw in a better camera.  It truly takes away from an otherwise great value.  However, the integrated shutter is nice for privacy.

"Great buy","For the price, it's not a bad laptop! I was skeptical about buying a laptop online, and one that isn't a Dell or Toshiba (I'm very picky about my electronics). But because of the Covid-19 Virus going around and with many electronic stores closed, I needed to improvise and buy a laptop for my work from home obligations. This is a very nice laptop. The battery life lasts a few hours on a full charge (about 5 hours, if I remember correctly) and the setup was fairly easy. This product does come with that S mode on it, but it was easily removed (a web window popped up on the website and allowed me to change it within a few seconds). My only issue with the laptop is that it tends to run a little slow sometimes. But it's not to the point I'm having to wait more than ten seconds. So I rate it a 4 out of 5. Would definitely recommend.

"Amazing laptop, especially at the $600 asking price","After passing off last year's model to my brother (3500U Flex 14), I got this as soon as I saw it posted up on Reddit. I'm thankful I did, since it was sold out within an hour or two and has been since. Let's get the rundown here. - Ryzen 5 4500U 6c6t APU - Radeon Vega 6 graphics - 16 GB of DDR4-3200 MHz dual-channel RAM (CL 22, but that's par for the course for a consumer laptop) - 256 GB SK Hynix NVMe SSD - 1080p IPS touchscreen w/digitizer (pen included!) Build quality is about as good as you can get without moving to all metal. The keyboard deck is rubberized, and the outside is built solidly - no creaking! Hinge is strong, but it opens up almost all the way with one hand (tilts towards the end). The overall design is darn near similar to last year's model, but built a bit more ""premium."" One exhaust vent at the back, but as you'll see later it really doesn't need 2. I mainly focused on CPU performance, as benchmarks for this flavor of Vega 6 are all over the place already, and given the thermals I saw performance should be what you'll find elsewhere. Long story short - roughly 10% faster than the 3500U's Vega 8 at less power (15 W vs 25 W). The benchmarks speak for themselves, but I was very surprised at what this thing was capable of. I ran these on the included USB-C wall charger (which was a surprising inclusion considering the laptop has a barrel jack for power). The only thing to keep in mind is that this was tested when my room temperature was in the upper 70s to lower 80s, so you could see the temp results as a ""worst case"" scenario. 77c absolute max during Geekbench is crazy for this thing, especially considering how thin it is. Never got too loud, either. Fan isn't whiny at all! Camera is acceptable. Nothing to write home about, but it'll work well enough for video calls. Battery is excellent - while browsing the web and watching videos, I have been consistently draining 10% per hour of use! That 10 hour claim from Lenovo seems pretty spot on. Honestly, I could think of only 3 things that would make this laptop better, but all of them would definitely drive up the price/bump it up a tier: - 120 Hz FreeSync display like the (crippled by 8 GB RAM) IdeaPad Slim 7 - Ryzen 4600U/4800U options for more threads (4700U option is now available in some places) - Metal construction I'll personally be upgrading the storage, but overall it's amazing.

"Budget laptop without the budget feel or performance.  Great 2 in 1 product.","**UPDATE 2 - 7/2/20 - Resolved an audio stuttering issue by turning off Dolby Audio processing in the Dolby app.** *UPDATE - 6/10/20 - Dropping a star.  Sent original back due to crashing issues when waking from sleep.  Wifi also dropped occasionally and had trouble reconnecting after sleep.  New unit seems to work fine.  Also replaced wireless card with Intel AX200 (need torx T5 bit to remove bottom panel).  Much faster and no dropped connections.  Still really like the laptop (and Amazon's return policy).* Overall usability – Everything about the laptop feels well-built and like it should cost hundreds more.  Incredibly fast processor, especially given the 15W TDP.  The AMD Ryzen 4000 series processors (7nm Zen 2) have really improved the thermals and efficiency to the same level as Intel (or better).  Between the 6 core processor and the  PCIe NVMe SSD the laptop flies.  Nothing I’ve thrown at it has been able to slow it down or make it stutter.  Benchmarks comparable to my HP desktop with i7-7700 (if in best performance mode while plugged in).  Applications open instantly in most cases.  Comes out of short-term sleep instantly.  Nice webcam privacy cover.  Fingerprint reader is best I’ve used in terms of accuracy and speed.  Fans are quiet under normal loads and a low non-annoying whirring when the GPU/CPU is taxed. Exterior – Very light weight (but not cheap feeling) and nice sturdy build.  Feels like it will hold up well.  Keyboard back-light adjustable.  Plenty of ports.  Hinges also feel built to last. Touchscreen – Sensitive and good feel (though I prefer matte to glossy).  Works well with included pen. Bloatware – Almost none (uninstalled Skype). Speakers – Above average for price range.  Not especially tinny sounding like cheaper laptops.  Don’t expect bass though.  The included Dolby equalizer software can help improve the sound if you don’t mind experimenting.  Side-mounted front-facing speakers are well placed. Screen – Brightness OK for indoor use, but I plan to run it at 90% brightness even on battery because anything less is too dim.  Colors are bright.  No noticeable back light bleed. Battery life – Above average for price range.  Really quite impressive.  Could easily last half to three-quarters of the stated 10 hours depending on the conditions (clearly not doing anything processor or graphics intensive for the duration, but web browsing, office work, or video viewing). Wireless/Bluetooth – Some occasional random disconnects and trouble connecting after sleep, likely due to Realtek wireless card.  Average speeds on my 5GHz home network. Keyboard/Trackpad – High quality feel.  You can tell when you’ve hit a key unlike cheaper laptops.  Miss the numpad, but knew it didn’t have one before I ordered.  Trackpad not over-sensitive or unresponsive.  Good balance, but still prefer a mouse. Graphics/Gaming – Played Two-Point Hospital on Steam at 1080p very high graphics setting.  Not very graphics intensive or an FPS, but the game is newer and frame-rate didn’t drop below 30 in game.  Game load times are ridiculously fast. Downsides – Mediocre webcam.  Soldered RAM (not a big deal w/16 GB, but if it goes bad it is a big problem).  Screen may not be bright enough for outdoor use and the glossy coating leads to reflections/glare when viewing from an angle.  Wireless card not great.  Stories of poor tech support (though, admittedly I’ve never interacted with them). **Don’t forget to create your USB backup drive from the Lenovo website for crashes/re-installs.  Or have the Windows 10 ISO handy on a USB drive and download the drivers/apps from the website.

"Solid product for the price, quality control is questionable","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. For <600, there's only 1 thing I want to complain: the ""Lenovo Representative"" knows nothing about their product. Yes, it has dual channel 16GB RAM @ 3200mhz, it ships with the Lenovo pencil included. Screen is only @ 250 nits, but I wouldn't call it a deal breaker unless you plan to use it outdoors a lot. Plastic machine but nothing feels cheap. The hinge is a little loose to my taste, the touchpad is a little shaky. Other than those, everything fits my needs. Very satisfying first day of use. Update: the audio starts to cutoff randomly from the 2nd day, all drivers and windows updates and BIOS are up to date. I contacted both Amazon and Lenovo tech support, after a remote session, the problem persists. Then I noticed the trackpad is shaky and sticky ( see video). So overall it's a nice product, but quality control can be a problem.

"","It was delivered today and I opened it. I was very excited, as I purchased this laptop to upgrade after 5 years. I charged the battery to full and switched on the laptop. Did all the setup and was just browsing different websites. Installing new apps and just the basic things. After 1 hour I observed that the fan speed was very high. and when I touched the laptop, it was burning hot. I also looked at the battery remaining and it was already drained by 30% in 1 hour.

"","Pretty happy so far after a month of use. I haven't had any problems with the heat, screens being brighter near the hinge, or the fan being loud, but people should be aware of those things before they think about using this for intense usage. I'd personally be careful about how you handle the hinge. The touchscreen itself is fantastic, switching from desktop to tablet mode in Windows is much easier than I expected. A HUGE plus for artists like me is that the pen works exactly like how you would expect other Wacom tablets to work (maybe not the fancier high end models, mind you), so this is a great entry way for people who are looking to get into digital art. You should market that more, Lenovo lol. There are only a few of shortcomings that I found so far. First, and a fairly small one, is that the battery isn't as great as they imply. I feel I'm only getting 6 hours on average, which isn't bad at all for a laptop, but no where near the 10 hours they proudly advertise. The colours on the screen are also not so great, and it isn't the best for brightly lit environments. I also wish there was a cover to snap on the keyboard while it's tablet mode, since I feel this would be something I want to use in tablet mode most of the time. One big issue unrelated to the actual product itself, however, is the warranty, which will be an absolute headache for whoever has to deal with that in Canada since we have to ship to the US, apparently. The warranty extension also isn't valid here, which is disappointing. Overall, I'm still having a good time using it as an art tool and for web browsing, but people here should be careful of the warranty issue and other small concerning aspects.

"","Really like the laptop slim, comes with the pen, good battery life not exceptional but will last you the day. Users that said they hear fan come on alot is due to high CPU usage, so example, installing software will boost that. But majority of the time its not loud only during very high CPU usage scenarios.  I have no issue with this as any laptop would do this. Speed is really fast when doing reuglar jobs, browsing, youtube, netflix, shopping.  16GB soldered ram should last the next 5 yrs.
